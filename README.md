# Bank Haolim Loan Application Analysis

Welcome to the Bank Haolim loan application presentation repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze how various factors influence loan approval decisions at Bank Haolim, using a loan dataset inspired by Kaggle.

We explore the data, create key performance indicators (KPIs), build predictive models, and provide a deployment solution with an API for loan approval prediction.

**Data source:** Kaggle loan dataset
